## 🎤 **Demo Script Highlights**

### **Opening:**
"This agent uses the ReAct pattern - it can reason about what to do, act using appropriate tools, and observe results to make better decisions. Let me show you the difference."

### **Key Transitions:**
- "Notice how it remembered our previous conversation..."
- "Watch how it adapts its explanation style without re-retrieving..."
- "Here's where we see the real power - complex legal reasoning..."
- "This demonstrates why ReAct is essential for legal analysis..."

### **Conclusion:**
"This shows how ReAct transforms a simple document search into an intelligent legal reasoning assistant that can actually help users understand complex legal relationships."

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Agent Doesn't Remember Context:**
- Check that conversation memory is working
- Verify the agent is using the advanced implementation
- Ensure previous queries were processed successfully

### **If Responses Are Generic:**
- Verify the document was processed correctly
- Check that vector store contains the document chunks
- Ensure the agent is using the retrieval and summarization tools

### **If Complex Queries Fail:**
- Check that all tools are properly initialized
- Verify the agent is using the full ReAct workflow
- Ensure the reasoning node is making proper decisions
